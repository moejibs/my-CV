<h3><i>Savoy Enterprise, St Johns Wood, London.</i></h3>
<p>At Savoy, the position I took on was customer service Supervisor and dealing with queries and bookings for a very busy chauffeur and courier firm which delivered a service to hotels in London. My role was to handle any enquiries customers, concierges and clients had. Having face to face meetings with the clients was essential every month to provide an excellent service. Overlooking the general staff and aiding with training and driver recruitment. Being a part of Savoy enterprises has had profound impact in the way I have obtained my skills which has therefore made my communication to be portrayed to the best of its ability.</p>
